# Hello-Kitty

This is a web application using a Cat Lie Generator API (https://github.com/browk876/my-api) to create a playful interface of dialing a phone to say... hello kitty.
While a regular dialphone has 12 dials, only 9 are used to represent a cat's 9 lives.

FUNCTIONS: 
When a user clicks on a box, it reveals a random Amanda-Cat image, plays a corresponding sound, and uses the API to display a randomly generated cat lie.
